A nebula is a giant cloud of dust and gas in space. 
Some nebulae (more than one nebula) come from the gas and dust thrown out by the explosion of a dying star, 
such as a supernova. Other nebulae are regions where new stars are beginning to form. 
For this reason, some nebulae are called "star nurseries.
